// Exclusive ownership policy
// This policy states that whenever a resource management object is copied, the resource handle is transferred from the source pointer to the destination pointer. In the process, the source pointer is set to nullptr to make ownership exclusive. At any time, the resource handle belongs only to a single object, which is responsible for its deletion when it is no longer needed.

// The code example on the right illustrates the basic idea of exclusive ownership.

// The class MyClass overwrites both the copy constructor as well as the assignment operator. Inside, the handle to the resource _myInt is first copied from the source object and then set to null so that only a single valid handle exists. After copying, the new object is responsible for properly deleting the memory resource on the heap. The output of the program looks like the following:


// resource allocated
// resource freed
// As can be seen, only a single resource is allocated and freed. So by passing handles and invalidating them, we can implement a basic version of an exclusive ownership policy. However, this example is not the way exclusive ownership is handled in the standard template library. One problem in this implementation is that for a short time there are effectively two valid handles to the same resource - after the handle has been copied and before it is set to nullptr. In concurrent programs, this would cause a data race for the resource. A much better alternative to handle exclusive ownership in C++ would be to use move semantics, which we will discuss shortly in a very detailed lesson.
