// Deep copying policy
// With this policy, copying and assigning class instances to each other is possible without the danger of resource conflicts. The idea is to allocate proprietary memory in the destination object and then to copy the content to which the source object handle is pointing into the newly allocated block of memory. This way, the content is preserved during copy or assignment. However, this approach increases the memory demands and the uniqueness of the data is lost: After the deep copy has been made, two versions of the same resource exist in memory.

// Let us look at an example in the code on the right.

// The deep-copy version of MyClass looks similar to the exclusive ownership policy: Both the assignment operator and the copy constructor have been overloaded with the source object passed by reference. But instead of copying the source handle (and then deleting it), a proprietary block of memory is allocated on the heap and the content of the source is copied into it.

// The output of the program looks like the following:


// resource allocated at address 0x100300060
// resource allocated at address 0x100300070 with _myInt = 42
// resource allocated at address 0x100300080 with _myInt = 42
// resource freed at address 0x100300080
// resource freed at address 0x100300070
// resource freed at address 0x100300060
// As can be seen, all copies have the same value of 42 while the address of the handle differs between source, dest1 and dest2.

// To conclude, the following figure illustrates the idea of a deep copy: [deep-copying-policy.png]
