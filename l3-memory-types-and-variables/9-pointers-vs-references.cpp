// Pointers vs. References
// As we have seen in the examples above, the use of pointers and references to directly manipulate function arguments in a memory-effective way is very similar. Let us compare the two methods in the code on the right.

// As can be seen, pointer and reference are both implemented by using a memory address. In the case of AddFour the caller does not even realize that val might be modified while with AddSix, the reference to val has to be explicitly written by using &.

// If passing by value needs to be avoided, both pointers and references are a way to achieve this. The following selection of properties contrasts the two methods so it will be easier to decide which to use from the perspective of the use-case at hand:

// Pointers can be declared without initialization. This means we can pass an uninitialized pointer to a function who then internally performs the initialization for us.

// Pointers can be reassigned to another memory block on the heap.

// References are usually easier to use (depending on the expertise level of the programmer). Sometimes however, if a third-party function is used without properly looking at the parameter definition, it might go unnoticed that a value has been modified.
